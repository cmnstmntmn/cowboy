%% Servers are encouraged to maintain open HTTP/3 connections for as long as
%possible but are permitted to terminate idle connections if necessary. When
%either endpoint chooses to close the HTTP/3 connection, the terminating
%endpoint SHOULD first send a GOAWAY frame (Section 5.2) so that both endpoints
%can reliably determine whether previously sent frames have been processed and
%gracefully complete or terminate any necessary remaining tasks.

%% 4. Expressing HTTP Semantics in HTTP/3
%% 4.1. HTTP Message Framing

%% An HTTP request/response exchange fully consumes a client-initiated
%bidirectional QUIC stream. After sending a request, a client MUST close the
%stream for sending. Unless using the CONNECT method (see Section 4.4), clients
%MUST NOT make stream closure dependent on receiving a response to their
%request. After sending a final response, the server MUST close the stream for
%sending. At this point, the QUIC stream is fully closed.
%% @todo What to do with clients that DON'T close the stream
%%       for sending after the request is sent?

%% If a client-initiated stream terminates without enough of the HTTP message
%to provide a complete response, the server SHOULD abort its response stream
%with the error code H3_REQUEST_INCOMPLETE.
%% @todo difficult!!

%% When the server does not need to receive the remainder of the request, it
%MAY abort reading the request stream, send a complete response, and cleanly
%close the sending part of the stream. The error code H3_NO_ERROR SHOULD be
%used when requesting that the client stop sending on the request stream.
%% @todo read_body related; h2 has this behavior but there is no corresponding test

%% 4.1.1. Request Cancellation and Rejection

%% When possible, it is RECOMMENDED that servers send an HTTP response with an
%appropriate status code rather than cancelling a request it has already begun
%processing.

%% Implementations SHOULD cancel requests by abruptly terminating any
%directions of a stream that are still open. To do so, an implementation resets
%the sending parts of streams and aborts reading on the receiving parts of
%streams; see Section 2.4 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

%% When the server cancels a request without performing any application
%processing, the request is considered "rejected". The server SHOULD abort its
%response stream with the error code H3_REQUEST_REJECTED. In this context,
%"processed" means that some data from the stream was passed to some higher
%layer of software that might have taken some action as a result. The client
%can treat requests rejected by the server as though they had never been sent
%at all, thereby allowing them to be retried later.

%% Servers MUST NOT use the H3_REQUEST_REJECTED error code for requests that
%were partially or fully processed. When a server abandons a response after
%partial processing, it SHOULD abort its response stream with the error code
%H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED.
%% @todo

%% Client SHOULD use the error code H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED to cancel requests.
%Upon receipt of this error code, a server MAY abruptly terminate the response
%using the error code H3_REQUEST_REJECTED if no processing was performed.
%Clients MUST NOT use the H3_REQUEST_REJECTED error code, except when a server
%has requested closure of the request stream with this error code.
%% @todo

%4.1.2. Malformed Requests and Responses
%A malformed request or response is one that is an otherwise valid sequence of
%frames but is invalid due to:
%
%the presence of prohibited fields or pseudo-header fields,
%% @todo reject_response_pseudo_headers
%% @todo reject_unknown_pseudo_headers
%% @todo reject_pseudo_headers_in_trailers

%the absence of mandatory pseudo-header fields,
%invalid values for pseudo-header fields,
%pseudo-header fields after fields,
%% @todo reject_pseudo_headers_after_regular_headers

%an invalid sequence of HTTP messages,
%the inclusion of invalid characters in field names or values.
%
%A request or response that is defined as having content when it contains a
%Content-Length header field (Section 8.6 of [HTTP]) is malformed if the value
%of the Content-Length header field does not equal the sum of the DATA frame
%lengths received. A response that is defined as never having content, even
%when a Content-Length is present, can have a non-zero Content-Length header
%field even though no content is included in DATA frames.
%
%For malformed requests, a server MAY send an HTTP response indicating the
%error prior to closing or resetting the stream.

%% 4.2.1. Field Compression
%% To allow for better compression efficiency, the Cookie header field
%([COOKIES]) MAY be split into separate field lines, each with one or more
%cookie-pairs, before compression. If a decompressed field section contains
%multiple cookie field lines, these MUST be concatenated into a single byte
%string using the two-byte delimiter of "; " (ASCII 0x3b, 0x20) before being
%passed into a context other than HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, such as an HTTP/1.1
%connection, or a generic HTTP server application.

%% 4.2.2. Header Size Constraints
%% An HTTP/3 implementation MAY impose a limit on the maximum size of the
%message header it will accept on an individual HTTP message. A server that
%receives a larger header section than it is willing to handle can send an HTTP
%431 (Request Header Fields Too Large) status code ([RFC6585]). The size of a
%field list is calculated based on the uncompressed size of fields, including
%the length of the name and value in bytes plus an overhead of 32 bytes for
%each field.
%% If an implementation wishes to advise its peer of this limit, it can be
%conveyed as a number of bytes in the SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE
%parameter.

%% 4.3.2. Response Pseudo-Header Fields
%% For responses, a single ":status" pseudo-header field is defined that
%carries the HTTP status code; see Section 15 of [HTTP]. This pseudo-header
%field MUST be included in all responses; otherwise, the response is malformed
%(see Section 4.1.2).
%% HTTP/3 does not define a way to carry the version or reason phrase that is
%included in an HTTP/1.1 status line. HTTP/3 responses implicitly have a
%protocol version of "3.0".

%% 4.4. The CONNECT Method
%% A CONNECT request MUST be constructed as follows:
%%The :method pseudo-header field is set to "CONNECT"
%%The :scheme and :path pseudo-header fields are omitted
%%The :authority pseudo-header field contains the host and port to connect to
%(equivalent to the authority-form of the request-target of CONNECT requests;
%see Section 7.1 of [HTTP]).
%% The request stream remains open at the end of the request to carry the data
%to be transferred. A CONNECT request that does not conform to these
%restrictions is malformed.
%%
%% Once the CONNECT method has completed, only DATA frames are permitted to be
%sent on the stream. Extension frames MAY be used if specifically permitted by
%the definition of the extension. Receipt of any other known frame type MUST be
%treated as a connection error of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.%% @todo + review
%how it should work beyond the handling of the CONNECT request

%% 4.5. HTTP Upgrade
%% HTTP/3 does not support the HTTP Upgrade mechanism (Section 7.8 of [HTTP])
%or the 101 (Switching Protocols) informational status code (Section 15.2.2 of
%[HTTP]).

%% 4.6. Server Push
%% The push ID space begins at zero and ends at a maximum value set by the
%MAX_PUSH_ID frame. In particular, a server is not able to push until after the
%client sends a MAX_PUSH_ID frame. A client sends MAX_PUSH_ID frames to control
%the number of pushes that a server can promise. A server SHOULD use push IDs
%sequentially, beginning from zero. A client MUST treat receipt of a push
%stream as a connection error of type H3_ID_ERROR when no MAX_PUSH_ID frame has
%been sent or when the stream references a push ID that is greater than the
%maximum push ID.
%% When the same push ID is promised on multiple request streams, the
%decompressed request field sections MUST contain the same fields in the same
%order, and both the name and the value in each field MUST be identical.
%% Not all requests can be pushed. A server MAY push requests that have the following properties:
%cacheable; see Section 9.2.3 of [HTTP]
%safe; see Section 9.2.1 of [HTTP]
%does not include request content or a trailer section
%
%% The server MUST include a value in the :authority pseudo-header field for
%which the server is authoritative. If the client has not yet validated the
%connection for the origin indicated by the pushed request, it MUST perform the
%same verification process it would do before sending a request for that origin
%on the connection; see Section 3.3. If this verification fails, the client
%MUST NOT consider the server authoritative for that origin.
%% Clients SHOULD send a CANCEL_PUSH frame upon receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE frame
%carrying a request that is not cacheable, is not known to be safe, that
%indicates the presence of request content, or for which it does not consider
%the server authoritative. Any corresponding responses MUST NOT be used or
%cached.
%% Ordering of a PUSH_PROMISE frame in relation to certain parts of the
%response is important. The server SHOULD send PUSH_PROMISE frames prior to
%sending HEADERS or DATA frames that reference the promised responses. This
%reduces the chance that a client requests a resource that will be pushed by
%the server.
%% Push stream data can also arrive after a client has cancelled a push. In
%this case, the client can abort reading the stream with an error code of
%H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED. This asks the server not to transfer additional data and
%indicates that it will be discarded upon receipt.

%% 5. Connection Closure
%% 5.1. Idle Connections
%% HTTP/3 implementations will need to open a new HTTP/3 connection for new
%requests if the existing connection has been idle for longer than the idle
%timeout negotiated during the QUIC handshake, and they SHOULD do so if
%approaching the idle timeout; see Section 10.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].
%% Servers SHOULD NOT actively keep connections open.

%% 5.2. Connection Shutdown
%% Endpoints initiate the graceful shutdown of an HTTP/3 connection by sending
%a GOAWAY frame. The GOAWAY frame contains an identifier that indicates to the
%receiver the range of requests or pushes that were or might be processed in
%this connection. The server sends a client-initiated bidirectional stream ID;
%the client sends a push ID. Requests or pushes with the indicated identifier
%or greater are rejected (Section 4.1.1) by the sender of the GOAWAY. This
%identifier MAY be zero if no requests or pushes were processed.
%% Upon sending a GOAWAY frame, the endpoint SHOULD explicitly cancel (see
%Sections 4.1.1 and 7.2.3) any requests or pushes that have identifiers greater
%than or equal to the one indicated, in order to clean up transport state for
%the affected streams. The endpoint SHOULD continue to do so as more requests
%or pushes arrive.
%% Endpoints MUST NOT initiate new requests or promise new pushes on the
%connection after receipt of a GOAWAY frame from the peer.
%% Requests on stream IDs less than the stream ID in a GOAWAY frame from the
%server might have been processed; their status cannot be known until a
%response is received, the stream is reset individually, another GOAWAY is
%received with a lower stream ID than that of the request in question, or the
%connection terminates.
%% Servers MAY reject individual requests on streams below the indicated ID if
%these requests were not processed.
%% If a server receives a GOAWAY frame after having promised pushes with a push
%ID greater than or equal to the identifier contained in the GOAWAY frame,
%those pushes will not be accepted.
%% Servers SHOULD send a GOAWAY frame when the closing of a connection is known
%in advance, even if the advance notice is small, so that the remote peer can
%know whether or not a request has been partially processed.
%% An endpoint MAY send multiple GOAWAY frames indicating different
%identifiers, but the identifier in each frame MUST NOT be greater than the
%identifier in any previous frame, since clients might already have retried
%unprocessed requests on another HTTP connection. Receiving a GOAWAY containing
%a larger identifier than previously received MUST be treated as a connection
%error of type H3_ID_ERROR.
%% An endpoint that is attempting to gracefully shut down a connection can send
%a GOAWAY frame with a value set to the maximum possible value (262-4 for
%servers, 262-1 for clients).
%% Even when a GOAWAY indicates that a given request or push will not be
%processed or accepted upon receipt, the underlying transport resources still
%exist. The endpoint that initiated these requests can cancel them to clean up
%transport state.
%% Once all accepted requests and pushes have been processed, the endpoint can
%permit the connection to become idle, or it MAY initiate an immediate closure
%of the connection. An endpoint that completes a graceful shutdown SHOULD use
%the H3_NO_ERROR error code when closing the connection.
%% If a client has consumed all available bidirectional stream IDs with
%requests, the server need not send a GOAWAY frame, since the client is unable
%to make further requests. @todo OK that one's some weird stuff lol

%% 5.3. Immediate Application Closure
%% Before closing the connection, a GOAWAY frame MAY be sent to allow the
%client to retry some requests. Including the GOAWAY frame in the same packet
%as the QUIC CONNECTION_CLOSE frame improves the chances of the frame being
%received by clients.

%% 6. Stream Mapping and Usage
%% 6.1. Bidirectional Streams
%% an HTTP/3 server SHOULD configure non-zero minimum values for the number of
%permitted streams and the initial stream flow-control window. So as to not
%unnecessarily limit parallelism, at least 100 request streams SHOULD be
%permitted at a time.

%% 6.2. Unidirectional Streams
%% Therefore, the transport parameters sent by both clients and servers MUST
%allow the peer to create at least three unidirectional streams. These
%transport parameters SHOULD also provide at least 1,024 bytes of flow-control
%credit to each unidirectional stream.
%% Note that an endpoint is not required to grant additional credits to create
%more unidirectional streams if its peer consumes all the initial credits
%before creating the critical unidirectional streams. Endpoints SHOULD create
%the HTTP control stream as well as the unidirectional streams required by
%mandatory extensions (such as the QPACK encoder and decoder streams) first,
%and then create additional streams as allowed by their peer.
%% Recipients of unknown stream types MUST either abort reading of the stream
%or discard incoming data without further processing. If reading is aborted,
%the recipient SHOULD use the H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR error code or a reserved
%error code (Section 8.1). The recipient MUST NOT consider unknown stream types
%to be a connection error of any kind.
%% As certain stream types can affect connection state, a recipient SHOULD NOT
%discard data from incoming unidirectional streams prior to reading the stream
%type.
%% Implementations MAY send stream types before knowing whether the peer
%supports them. However, stream types that could modify the state or semantics
%of existing protocol components, including QPACK or other extensions, MUST NOT
%be sent until the peer is known to support them.
%% A receiver MUST tolerate unidirectional streams being closed or reset prior
%to the reception of the unidirectional stream header.

%% 6.2.1. Control Streams
%% A control stream is indicated by a stream type of 0x00. Data on this stream
%consists of HTTP/3 frames, as defined in Section 7.2.
%% Each side MUST initiate a single control stream at the beginning of the
%connection and send its SETTINGS frame as the first frame on this stream. If
%the first frame of the control stream is any other frame type, this MUST be
%treated as a connection error of type H3_MISSING_SETTINGS. Only one control
%stream per peer is permitted; receipt of a second stream claiming to be a
%control stream MUST be treated as a connection error of type
%H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR. The sender MUST NOT close the control stream, and
%the receiver MUST NOT request that the sender close the control stream. If
%either control stream is closed at any point, this MUST be treated as a
%connection error of type H3_CLOSED_CRITICAL_STREAM. Connection errors are
%described in Section 8.
%% Because the contents of the control stream are used to manage the behavior
%of other streams, endpoints SHOULD provide enough flow-control credit to keep
%the peer's control stream from becoming blocked.

%% 6.2.2. Push Streams
%% A push stream is indicated by a stream type of 0x01, followed by the push ID
%of the promise that it fulfills, encoded as a variable-length integer. The
%remaining data on this stream consists of HTTP/3 frames, as defined in Section
%7.2, and fulfills a promised server push by zero or more interim HTTP
%responses followed by a single final HTTP response, as defined in Section 4.1.
%Server push and push IDs are described in Section 4.6.
%% Only servers can push; if a server receives a client-initiated push stream,
%this MUST be treated as a connection error of type H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR.
%% Each push ID MUST only be used once in a push stream header. If a client
%detects that a push stream header includes a push ID that was used in another
%push stream header, the client MUST treat this as a connection error of type
%H3_ID_ERROR.

%% 6.2.3. Reserved Stream Types
%% Stream types of the format 0x1f * N + 0x21 for non-negative integer values
%of N are reserved to exercise the requirement that unknown types be ignored.
%These streams have no semantics, and they can be sent when application-layer
%padding is desired. They MAY also be sent on connections where no data is
%currently being transferred. Endpoints MUST NOT consider these streams to have
%any meaning upon receipt.
%% The payload and length of the stream are selected in any manner the sending
%implementation chooses. When sending a reserved stream type, the
%implementation MAY either terminate the stream cleanly or reset it. When
%resetting the stream, either the H3_NO_ERROR error code or a reserved error
%code (Section 8.1) SHOULD be used.

%% 7. HTTP Framing Layer
%% Note that, unlike QUIC frames, HTTP/3 frames can span multiple packets.

%% 7.1. Frame Layout
%% Each frame's payload MUST contain exactly the fields identified in its
%description. A frame payload that contains additional bytes after the
%identified fields or a frame payload that terminates before the end of the
%identified fields MUST be treated as a connection error of type
%H3_FRAME_ERROR. In particular, redundant length encodings MUST be verified to
%be self-consistent; see Section 10.8.
%% When a stream terminates cleanly, if the last frame on the stream was
%truncated, this MUST be treated as a connection error of type H3_FRAME_ERROR.
%Streams that terminate abruptly may be reset at any point in a frame.

%% 7.2. Frame Definitions
%% 7.2.1. DATA
%% DATA frames MUST be associated with an HTTP request or response. If a DATA
%frame is received on a control stream, the recipient MUST respond with a
%connection error of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.

%% 7.2.2. HEADERS
%% HEADERS frames can only be sent on request streams or push streams. If a
%HEADERS frame is received on a control stream, the recipient MUST respond with
%a connection error of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.

%% 7.2.3. CANCEL_PUSH
%% When a client sends a CANCEL_PUSH frame, it is indicating that it does not
%wish to receive the promised resource. The server SHOULD abort sending the
%resource, but the mechanism to do so depends on the state of the corresponding
%push stream. If the server has not yet created a push stream, it does not
%create one. If the push stream is open, the server SHOULD abruptly terminate
%that stream. If the push stream has already ended, the server MAY still
%abruptly terminate the stream or MAY take no action.
%% A server sends a CANCEL_PUSH frame to indicate that it will not be
%fulfilling a promise that was previously sent. The client cannot expect the
%corresponding promise to be fulfilled, unless it has already received and
%processed the promised response. Regardless of whether a push stream has been
%opened, a server SHOULD send a CANCEL_PUSH frame when it determines that
%promise will not be fulfilled. If a stream has already been opened, the server
%can abort sending on the stream with an error code of H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED.
%% Sending a CANCEL_PUSH frame has no direct effect on the state of existing
%push streams. A client SHOULD NOT send a CANCEL_PUSH frame when it has already
%received a corresponding push stream. A push stream could arrive after a
%client has sent a CANCEL_PUSH frame, because a server might not have processed
%the CANCEL_PUSH. The client SHOULD abort reading the stream with an error code
%of H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED.
%% A CANCEL_PUSH frame is sent on the control stream. Receiving a CANCEL_PUSH
%frame on a stream other than the control stream MUST be treated as a
%connection error of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.
%% If a CANCEL_PUSH frame is received that references a push ID greater than
%currently allowed on the connection, this MUST be treated as a connection
%error of type H3_ID_ERROR.
%% If the client receives a CANCEL_PUSH frame, that frame might identify a push
%ID that has not yet been mentioned by a PUSH_PROMISE frame due to reordering.
%If a server receives a CANCEL_PUSH frame for a push ID that has not yet been
%mentioned by a PUSH_PROMISE frame, this MUST be treated as a connection error
%of type H3_ID_ERROR.

%% 7.2.4. SETTINGS
%% A SETTINGS frame MUST be sent as the first frame of each control stream (see
%Section 6.2.1) by each peer, and it MUST NOT be sent subsequently. If an
%endpoint receives a second SETTINGS frame on the control stream, the endpoint
%MUST respond with a connection error of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.
%% SETTINGS frames MUST NOT be sent on any stream other than the control
%stream. If an endpoint receives a SETTINGS frame on a different stream, the
%endpoint MUST respond with a connection error of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.
%% The same setting identifier MUST NOT occur more than once in the SETTINGS
%frame. A receiver MAY treat the presence of duplicate setting identifiers as a
%connection error of type H3_SETTINGS_ERROR.
%% An implementation MUST ignore any parameter with an identifier it does not understand.

%% 7.2.4.1. Defined SETTINGS Parameters
%% Setting identifiers of the format 0x1f * N + 0x21 for non-negative integer
%values of N are reserved to exercise the requirement that unknown identifiers
%be ignored. Such settings have no defined meaning. Endpoints SHOULD include at
%least one such setting in their SETTINGS frame. Endpoints MUST NOT consider
%such settings to have any meaning upon receipt.
%% -> try sending COW\0 BOY\0 if that fits the encoding and restrictions
%otherwise something similar
%% Setting identifiers that were defined in [HTTP/2] where there is no
%corresponding HTTP/3 setting have also been reserved (Section 11.2.2). These
%reserved settings MUST NOT be sent, and their receipt MUST be treated as a
%connection error of type H3_SETTINGS_ERROR.

%% 7.2.4.2. Initialization
%% An HTTP implementation MUST NOT send frames or requests that would be
%invalid based on its current understanding of the peer's settings.
%% All settings begin at an initial value. Each endpoint SHOULD use these
%initial values to send messages before the peer's SETTINGS frame has arrived,
%as packets carrying the settings can be lost or delayed. When the SETTINGS
%frame arrives, any settings are changed to their new values.
%% Endpoints MUST NOT require any data to be received from the peer prior to
%sending the SETTINGS frame; settings MUST be sent as soon as the transport is
%ready to send data.
%% A server MAY accept 0-RTT and subsequently provide different settings in its
%SETTINGS frame. If 0-RTT data is accepted by the server, its SETTINGS frame
%MUST NOT reduce any limits or alter any values that might be violated by the
%client with its 0-RTT data. The server MUST include all settings that differ
%from their default values. If a server accepts 0-RTT but then sends settings
%that are not compatible with the previously specified settings, this MUST be
%treated as a connection error of type H3_SETTINGS_ERROR. If a server accepts
%0-RTT but then sends a SETTINGS frame that omits a setting value that the
%client understands (apart from reserved setting identifiers) that was
%previously specified to have a non-default value, this MUST be treated as a
%connection error of type H3_SETTINGS_ERROR.

%% 7.2.5. PUSH_PROMISE
%% A server MUST NOT use a push ID that is larger than the client has provided
%in a MAX_PUSH_ID frame (Section 7.2.7).
%% A server MAY use the same push ID in multiple PUSH_PROMISE frames. If so,
%the decompressed request header sets MUST contain the same fields in the same
%order, and both the name and the value in each field MUST be exact matches.
%% Allowing duplicate references to the same push ID is primarily to reduce
%duplication caused by concurrent requests. A server SHOULD avoid reusing a
%push ID over a long period. Clients are likely to consume server push
%responses and not retain them for reuse over time. Clients that see a
%PUSH_PROMISE frame that uses a push ID that they have already consumed and
%discarded are forced to ignore the promise.
%% A client MUST NOT send a PUSH_PROMISE frame. A server MUST treat the receipt
%of a PUSH_PROMISE frame as a connection error of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.

%% 7.2.6. GOAWAY
%% (not sure what applies to the server, should the server reject GOAWAY on
%non-control stream too?)

%% 7.2.7. MAX_PUSH_ID
%% Receipt of a MAX_PUSH_ID frame on any other stream MUST be treated as a
%connection error of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.
%% The maximum push ID is unset when an HTTP/3 connection is created, meaning
%that a server cannot push until it receives a MAX_PUSH_ID frame.
%% A MAX_PUSH_ID frame cannot reduce the maximum push ID; receipt of a
%MAX_PUSH_ID frame that contains a smaller value than previously received MUST
%be treated as a connection error of type H3_ID_ERROR.

%% 7.2.8. Reserved Frame Types
%% These frames have no semantics, and they MAY be sent on any stream where
%frames are allowed to be sent. This enables their use for application-layer
%padding. Endpoints MUST NOT consider these frames to have any meaning upon
%receipt.
%% Frame types that were used in HTTP/2 where there is no corresponding HTTP/3
%frame have also been reserved (Section 11.2.1). These frame types MUST NOT be
%sent, and their receipt MUST be treated as a connection error of type
%H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.

%% 8. Error Handling
%% An endpoint MAY choose to treat a stream error as a connection error under
%certain circumstances, closing the entire connection in response to a
%condition on a single stream.
%% Because new error codes can be defined without negotiation (see Section 9),
%use of an error code in an unexpected context or receipt of an unknown error
%code MUST be treated as equivalent to H3_NO_ERROR.

%% 8.1. HTTP/3 Error Codes
%% H3_INTERNAL_ERROR (0x0102): An internal error has occurred in the HTTP stack.
%% H3_FRAME_ERROR (0x0106): A frame that fails to satisfy layout requirements
%or with an invalid size was received.
%% H3_EXCESSIVE_LOAD (0x0107): The endpoint detected that its peer is
%exhibiting a behavior that might be generating excessive load.
%% (more)
%% Error codes of the format 0x1f * N + 0x21 for non-negative integer values of
%N are reserved to exercise the requirement that unknown error codes be treated
%as equivalent to H3_NO_ERROR (Section 9). Implementations SHOULD select an
%error code from this space with some probability when they would have sent
%H3_NO_ERROR.

%% 9. Extensions to HTTP/3
%% Extensions are permitted to use new frame types (Section 7.2), new settings
%(Section 7.2.4.1), new error codes (Section 8), or new unidirectional stream
%types (Section 6.2). Registries are established for managing these extension
%points: frame types (Section 11.2.1), settings (Section 11.2.2), error codes
%(Section 11.2.3), and stream types (Section 11.2.4).
%% Implementations MUST ignore unknown or unsupported values in all extensible
%protocol elements. Implementations MUST discard data or abort reading on
%unidirectional streams that have unknown or unsupported types. This means that
%any of these extension points can be safely used by extensions without prior
%arrangement or negotiation. However, where a known frame type is required to
%be in a specific location, such as the SETTINGS frame as the first frame of
%the control stream (see Section 6.2.1), an unknown frame type does not satisfy
%that requirement and SHOULD be treated as an error.
%% If a setting is used for extension negotiation, the default value MUST be
%defined in such a fashion that the extension is disabled if the setting is
%omitted.

%% 10. Security Considerations
%% 10.3. Intermediary-Encapsulation Attacks
%% Requests or responses containing invalid field names MUST be treated as malformed.
%% Any request or response that contains a character not permitted in a field
%value MUST be treated as malformed.

%% 10.5. Denial-of-Service Considerations
%% Implementations SHOULD track the use of these features and set limits on
%their use. An endpoint MAY treat activity that is suspicious as a connection
%error of type H3_EXCESSIVE_LOAD, but false positives will result in disrupting
%valid connections and requests.

%% 10.5.1. Limits on Field Section Size
%% An endpoint can use the SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE (Section 4.2.2)
%setting to advise peers of limits that might apply on the size of field
%sections.
%% A server that receives a larger field section than it is willing to handle
%can send an HTTP 431 (Request Header Fields Too Large) status code
%([RFC6585]).

%% 10.6. Use of Compression
%% Implementations communicating on a secure channel MUST NOT compress content
%that includes both confidential and attacker-controlled data unless separate
%compression contexts are used for each source of data. Compression MUST NOT be
%used if the source of data cannot be reliably determined.

%% 10.8. Frame Parsing
%% An implementation MUST ensure that the length of a frame exactly matches the
%length of the fields it contains.

%% 10.9. Early Data
%% The anti-replay mitigations in [HTTP-REPLAY] MUST be applied when using HTTP/3 with 0-RTT.

%% 10.10. Migration
%% Certain HTTP implementations use the client address for logging or
%access-control purposes. Since a QUIC client's address might change during a
%connection (and future versions might support simultaneous use of multiple
%addresses), such implementations will need to either actively retrieve the
%client's current address or addresses when they are relevant or explicitly
%accept that the original address might change. -> documentation for now

%% 11.2.1. Frame Types
%% Reserved types: 0x02 0x06 0x08 0x09

%% 11.2.2. Settings Parameters
%% Reserved settings: 0x00 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05

%% Appendix A. Considerations for Transitioning from HTTP/2
%% A.1. Streams
%% QUIC considers a stream closed when all data has been received and sent data
%has been acknowledged by the peer. HTTP/2 considers a stream closed when the
%frame containing the END_STREAM bit has been committed to the transport. As a
%result, the stream for an equivalent exchange could remain "active" for a
%longer period of time. HTTP/3 servers might choose to permit a larger number
%of concurrent client-initiated bidirectional streams to achieve equivalent
%concurrency to HTTP/2, depending on the expected usage patterns. ->
%documentation?

%% A.3. HTTP/2 SETTINGS Parameters
%% SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE (0x05): This setting has no equivalent in HTTP/3.
%Specifying a setting with the identifier 0x05 (corresponding to the
%SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE parameter) in the HTTP/3 SETTINGS frame is an error.
%-> do we still want a limit, if so how?
